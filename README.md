## How to use
1. Copy the file `startproject.py` to the directory where you will create the flask project.   
2. Run with the command:
~~~sh
$ python3 startproject.py your_project_name --venv --sqlal
~~~
> IMPORTANT
> - Do not use spaces in your project name.  Prefer underscores instead spaces.
> - The `--venv` argument indicates that you want to create a virtual environment.  It will be created inside the project's root folder as `.venv`.
> - The `--sqlal` argument indicates that you want to install SQLAlchemy in your project.
> - If you don't pass any arguments, they will be asked for you.   
   

In the `Makefile` file, we have some useful commands, which we use with the `make` command, such as:   

| **command**        | **what he does**                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `make clean`       | clears the project folder                         |
| `make install`     | install our project as a package python           |
| `make install-dev` | similar to install, but with requirements-dev.txt |
| `make test`        | run tests                                         |
| `make run`         | run flask                                         |
| `make run-dev`     | run flask in the development environment          |
